## Build in Docker (First challenge, work with Jose)
Build a docker image containing the blog you built.

At this point, you should have a blog site that should be deployable anywhere, ergo, you should be able to give me the image and I can boot it.

## Deploy Container to the Cloud
Here youâ€™re going to push that image to a registry, and deploy it to the cloud in a kubernetes cluster. Use your free tier in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Create a CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins to deploy your application
Utilize jenkins to build a pipeline for the application. You'll have to build a second environment to host a staging version of your environment.

## Write terraform Code to define your infrastructure
Write terraform to implement your k8s cluster. Jose will probably have to assist you on this.
